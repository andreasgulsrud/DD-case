            <h3>About Andreas</h3>
                <section>
                    When I make something, school assignments or work in general, I always try to understand the needs of a potential user. Whether he or she is about to buy a bus ticket, or do some online shopping, I want to make the technology functional and user friendly.
                    <p>My main focus lies within coding and programming. I enjoy being creative with technology, especially as a contributor in teams with engaged co-workers. This is where I am looking forward to develop myself the next years.</p>
                    <p>As you probably can tell from my projects above, I’m comfortable with coding languages such as HTML and CSS, and I’m trying to spend as much time as possible to restrain JavaScript as a professional before graduation. I have also used JavaScript libraries, some design and prototyping programmes, Electron and Arduino for school projects.</p>
                    <p>My short term goals is to get familiar with, and learn how to use, Node.js and JSON as back-end languages, as well as SASS and HAML as preprocessors. This is all set up in my school schedule and calendar for the spring 2019 semester.</p>
                    <p>I really enjoy the sense of achievement, and thats why Im looking for a workplace where development is in focus, and where learning from each other is highly appreciated.</p>
                    I am always open for a conversation, so please find my mail and/or phone number in the footer :)
